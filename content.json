        "Contributed to an OpenAI GPT Realtime voicebot that automates customer calls, appointment bookings, and storage reservations through MCP tool calls, service APIs, and webhook flows.",
        "Built a race-safe async TTL cache with signal-based refresh; cut appointment-slot lookups from ~1 s network calls to ~7 ms in-memory reads.",
        "Prefetched session-level customer data so the LLM can speak without ~3 s of dead air, making calls feel human-paced.",
        "Designed resilient phone-number extraction across OpenAI payload shapes by generalizing attribute patterns into robust regexes.",
        "Proposed and prototyped merging the call-handling server and MCP server into one deployable unit with custom routes to minimize codebase.",
        "Converted messy customer CSVs into reusable domain entities and Pydantic models for safer, structured use across services."
